Here we took the PPO implementation from: https://github.com/lcswillems/rl-starter-files
To run GateL0RD in the MiniGrid domain, replace the corresponding classes from the linked repository with our implementations.
The scripts train_fc.py and evaluate_fc.py act like train.py and evaluate.py from the repository, only they need to be called from an external main as a function.
visualize.py works like the original script but also supports GateL0RD.
